## Foundations of ML for MLOPS

### Data Science life cycle

1. Problem Definition
   - Goal: Understand the business or research problem to solve with ML.
2. Data Collection
   - Goal: Gather the relevant data needed for modeling.
3. Data Preprocessing
   - Goal: Clean and prepare data for model training.
4. Feature Engineering
   - Goal: Create informative features to improve model performance.
5. Model Selection
   - Goal: Choose the most appropriate algorithm(s) for the task.
6. Model Training
   - Goal: Train the model using training data.
   - Process: The algorithm learns patterns from data and adjusts its parameters to minimize error (e.g., using gradient descent).
7. Model Evaluation
   - Goal: Assess model performance on unseen data.
8. Model Tuning
   - Goal: Improve performance by tuning hyperparameters.
9. Deployment
   - Goal: Integrate the model into a production environment.
10. Monitoring and Maintainance
    - Goal: Ensure the model continues to perform well over time.

**What is MLOPS**

<p>MLOps (short for Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices, tools, and principles that combine Machine Learning (ML) and DevOps to help manage the end-to-end lifecycle of ML models â€” from development to production, monitoring, and maintenance.</p>

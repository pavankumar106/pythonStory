### Decision tree algorithms in general

<p>Tree-based algorithms are a class of machine learning methods that use decision trees to make predictions or classifications. These algorithms model decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure, where each node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf represents a final output or class label.</p>

#### Types

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs)

**Homogeneity**

<p>Homogeneity refers to how similar the data points are within a groupâ€”typically a node in a decision tree.</p>
